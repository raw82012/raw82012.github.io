<h1>Tennis Basics</h1>
<h2>What is Tennis?</h2>
<p>Tennis is a racket sport which unvolves 2-4 players. Each racket is used to strike a ball
over a net seperating the opponents. The object of the game is to manuever the ball in such a way that
the opponent cannot return the ball in a valid way.</p>

<h2 style= "text-align:center">Etiquett</h2>
<p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA)
 provides an extensive guide to the unwritten rules of tennis known as The Code.</p>
 <ul>
<li>Players should always shake hands at the beginning and end of the game.</li>
<li>Players are expected to be honest. 
If they are unsure about a line call, they 
should call the shot in. An opponent always gets the benefit of doubt.</li>
<li>The pace of play is controlled by the server. 
The receiver should be aware of this and if not ready, should make no effort to return the serve.</li>
<li>The score is to be announced by the server</li>
<li>A player should avoid making any form of loud noises, such as grunting.</li>
<li>Spectators should refrain from making loud noises while players are in play.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style= "text-align:center">Point System</h2>
<p style = "text-align:center"> Here is a basic explanation of the point system. The players will decide who serves first. Whenever the ball is not returned, she or he
 who was not able to return properly gets no points, and the other player gets a point. The scoring terms are shown below. 
 When a server states the score, she will say her score first, then the opponents score second.</p>

	<th>Scoring Term</th><th>Points</th>

<tr>
	<td>No Point</td><td>Love</td>

<tr>
	<td>First Point</td><td>15</td>

<tr>
	<td>Second Point</td><td>30</td>

	<td>Third Point</td><td>40</td>
